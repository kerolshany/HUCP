            <p> As previously discussed, Computer Science is not a hardware-based study, 
                    in fact, it is largely based on mathematics and mathematical equations. <br>
                    The operation of computers started only after advances in mathematics and logic. The mathematical foundation of computers is logic.<br>
                     Other fields like calculus, probability theory, and set theory are mathematical fields 
                    that are applied in computers programs but are not very important. However, logic can be a basis for all types of mathematics.

                Who other to talk about when mathematics is mentioned other than the father of algebra, Muhammed al-Khwarizmi. <br>
                  Having been the first known mathematician to work on algorism in 830 BC.<br> which is the technique used to perform basic arithmetic using Hindu-Arabic numerals.
                    Algorithm was then derived from the study of algorithm.

Then in 1815 came the largely self-taught mathematician, 
George Boole, who invented Boolean algebra. It is a system where there are only 2 possible values,
 either 1 or 0, which has greatly contributed in the invention of logic gates later on in 1954.

                In 1815 was also Ada Lovelace,<br>
                 which was considered the first ever computer scientist for writing about her (The Analytical Engine.)<br>
                  She worked alongside Charles Baggage, also an English mathematician,<br> whose work she became interested in as early as 1833.<br>
                   She programed for her Analytical Engine, where the early programming language (Ada) was named after her.<Br>
                    As Baggage worked on building it, sadly he was never able to completely built the engine.

        In 1912 was Alan Turing, previously mentioned, was both a computer scientist and a mathematician.
         Mathematically he worked on computation theory, for which he then designed his turing machine - 
         an entirely virtual abstract computing device able to perform mathematical equations and follow instructions. Using his machine, 
         Turing was able to place a fundamental limit on the power of computation as he figured some mathematical equations that could not be solved using algorithms.
         Turing is considered a founding father of artifical intelligence and theoretical computer science.
