<h2 id="m18">Notable Accomplishments</h2>
<pre id=m19>
 Musk was 24 years old when he moved to California to pursue a Ph.D. in applied physics at Stanford University. 
But, with the Internet exploding and Silicon Valley booming, Musk had entrepreneurial visions dancing in his head.
 He left the Ph.D. program after just two days.
 <a href=https://www.paypal.com/eg/home  ="-blank" ><h2 id="m18">  X.com</h2></a>
In 1995, with $28,000 and his younger brother Kimbal at his side, Musk started Zip2, a web software company that would help newspapers develop online city guides.
In 1999, Zip2 was acquired by Compaq’s AltaVista web search engine for a whopping $340 million.
Musk used his Zip2 buyout money to create X.com, which he intended to shape into the future of banking.
 X.com was merged with a money transfer firm called Confinity, and the resulting company came to be known as PayPal.
 Musk was then ousted from the company before it was bought by eBay for $1.5 billion, though he left with $180 million worth in stock.
 <a href=https://www.tesla.com/ ="-blank" ><h2 id="m18">  Tesla</h2></a>
First, he contributed funding—about $70 million. Then, in 2004, Musk joined engineers Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning to help run Tesla Motors, where Musk was integral in designing the Tesla Roadster, an electric car. 
Although After Eberhard was ousted from the firm in 2007, following a series of disagreements, Musk seized management control as CEO and product architect. 
Under his watch, Tesla has become one of the world’s most popular and coveted car brands.
In addition to producing electric vehicles, Tesla maintains a robust presence in the solar energy space, thanks to its acquisition of SolarCity.
Founded in 2006, this clean-energy-services company currently produces two rechargeable solar batteries, mainly used for stationary energy storage purposes.
The smaller Powerwall was developed for home backup power and off-the-grid use, while the larger Powerpack is intended for commercial or electric utility grid use.
 <a href=https://www.spacex.com/ target="-blank" ><h2 id="m18"> Space X</h2></a>
Musk used much of the proceeds of his PayPal sale to found Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, commonly known as SpaceX, an interstellar travel company. 
By his own account, Musk spent $100 million to found SpaceX in 2002.
With SpaceX, Musk landed several high-profile contracts with NASA and the U.S. Air Force to design rockets and conduct military missions. 
Musk has been vocal about his plans to send an astronaut to Mars by 2025 in a collaborative effort with NASA.
 <a href=https://twitter.com/target="-blank" ><h2 id="m18">Twitter</h2></a>
twitter said Monday it has reached a deal with Musk, who will buy Twitter for $54.20 a share in cash, valuing the influential social media site at about $44 billion. 
The announcement came after Musk rejected a seat on Twitter's board.
 With a 9.2% stake in Twitter, Musk is one of the company's largest shareholders.
